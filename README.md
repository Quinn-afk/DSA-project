Project description: Our group was tasked in creating efficient phonebook algorithm for a Namibian telecommunications company. We decided to utilize the hash map in java, 
where the contact number was kept as the value and the contact name served as the key. The case structure that we uused for the main menu, 
which provides users with the ability to add, search, delete, and update contacts.
